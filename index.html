    <h3>One more semester till I'm done</h3>
    <p>
        I did an internship over the summer last year, and we used Angular and ASP to make web applications there, however I occasionally make my own projects using tauri with a react frontend. So web programming is an interest both professionally and personally. Plus its used almost everywhere, so its really helpful to know for the job market. 
    </p>
    <h3>What I would like to learn from this course is:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating backends (I've done it before but I almost always have to rely on some kind of tutorial) </li>
        <li>Get a better understanding of database migrations</li>
        <li>Get a better understand of Model View Controller arcitecture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If it wasn't clear from my wants list, I mainly worked as a frontend developer, so while I can do backend stuff, I'm much less proficient at it</p>
